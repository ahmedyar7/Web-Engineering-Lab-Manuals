# Web Engineering Journal & Portfolio

This project serves as a central dashboard and portfolio for a Web Engineering course (2025). It functions as a navigational index, allowing users to view practical code demonstrations and experiments completed throughout the semester.

### Project Overview

The portfolio acts as a gateway to 13 distinct lab exercises, documenting the progression from static markup to dynamic, data-driven web applications.

### Covered Topics

-   **HTML5 & Semantics:** Basic structure, tables, and semantic portfolio creation (Labs 01-02).
-   **CSS Architecture:** Styling, the Box Model, responsive media queries, and a custom 12-column grid system (Labs 03-05).
-   **UI Frameworks:** Rapid development using Bootstrap 5 (Lab 06).
-   **JavaScript Logic:** DOM manipulation (Calculator), CRUD operations (Recipe Manager), and Modern ES6+ syntax (Labs 07-08, 10).
-   **Asynchronous Programming:** Consuming third-party APIs (NewsAPI) and utilizing Async/Await patterns (Labs 09, 11).
-   **Libraries & UX:** Data visualization using Chart.js and interactive multi-step user interfaces (Labs 12-13).
